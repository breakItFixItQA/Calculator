# 🧮 Simple Calculator (Java)

This is a basic Java console application that functions as a simple calculator. It allows users to perform **addition, subtraction, multiplication**, and **division** on two numbers provided via user input.

### 💡 What It Does

The program:
- Prompts the user to input two numbers.
- Displays a menu of operations:  
  `1. Addition`  
  `2. Subtraction`  
  `3. Multiplication`  
  `4. Division`
- Executes the selected operation and displays the result.
- Handles invalid choices and prevents division by zero.

### 🛠 How to Run

1. Copy the code from `Calculator.java` into your Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code, etc.).
2. Compile and run the program.
3. Follow the prompts to enter two numbers and choose an operation.
